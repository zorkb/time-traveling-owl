# time-traveling-owl
an arguably fun game about an owl who travels through time.

concept: 

you adopt an owl who loves food, entertainment, and travelling through the fabric of space-time. 

steps:

the game begins when your owl is just an egg. keep the egg warm and perform healing reiki ceremonies 3 times in a day, and your owl will hatch!

give your owl a name - it will be displayed on screen and used in prompts.
feed your owl 3 times a day, and make sure to give it academic philosophy to read so it stays entertained. you will have options of different owl food and books to give your owl. if your owl doesn’t eat or read for a certain amount of time, he will leave from hunger/boredom. 
at night, be sure to turn the light off and the nightlight on. if your owl doesn’t sleep for 2 nights with no naps, he might leave.
1 hour = 1 minute. 24 hrs = 24 mins.
if any category = 10, owl leaves
if cumulative category points = 24, owl leaves
at any time, the user can change to a new time and place. that’s the benefit of having a time-traveling pet.
